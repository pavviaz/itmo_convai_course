uae,"The U.A.E. offers a familiar environment for Western tourists, with modern malls filled with Western products. The less well-known side of the U.A.E. includes remote desert dunes and craggy wadis. Alcohol is widely available in Dubai and tourist hotels, but not in Sharjah. The roads and public facilities are modern but can be crowded. Supermarkets offer a variety of products from Europe and the U.S., along with local and regional items. Major international chains operate widely, but there are still traditional souks filled with products from around the world. Contrary to what is printed in guidebooks, the souks in Abu Dhabi were torn down in 2006 and no longer exist. The souks in Dubai are still worth exploring. The text outlines the visa requirements for citizens of various countries to enter the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Citizens of GCC nations do not require a visa and may stay, work, and travel in the UAE indefinitely. Citizens of the European Union (except Ireland), Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, Seychelles, Switzerland, and Vatican City do not require a visa for stays of up to 90 days within a 180 day period. Citizens of Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Ireland, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as persons holding British National (Overseas) passports, may obtain a free visa on arrival valid for 30 days, with the possibility of extension for a fee. Citizens of India holding a valid US visa or Green Card do not require an advance visa for visit purposes and can get a visa on arrival, valid for 14 days, from any port of entry. Citizens of any country except Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, and Yemen may enter the UAE for up to 96 hours (4 days) after obtaining a transit visa at the airport, provided they continue to a third destination and have a hotel booking. Several other countries are eligible for free hotel/tour-sponsored tourism visas. All other nationalities will be required to apply for a visa in advance, which will require a sponsor from inside the UAE. Israeli passport holders previously needed to make advance arrangements for an entry permit, but following an Israel-UAE peace agreement in August 2020, Israeli and Emirati citizens can now go to each other's countries visa-free. However, some discrimination and distrust may still exist due to cultural, religious, and political differences. Travelers from India may need to obtain a stamp of 'OK to Board' before traveling to the UAE. The beach is a popular tourist attraction in the UAE, with warm, clean, and beautiful waters. There are long stretches of white-sand beaches, ranging from undeveloped to highly touristed. Snorkeling and diving can be magnificent, especially along the eastern (Indian Ocean) coast. The desert offers dramatic views and terrifying rides in fast-driven safaris. Ski Dubai, the world's third largest indoor ski slope, opened in December 2005 and is located in the Dubai Emirates Mall. The Marina Mall in Abu Dhabi is scheduled to open an indoor ski slope in 2007-2008. Desert safari trips can be a fun experience for tourists and can be booked ahead or as late as the day before. Most packages include a heart-pumping drive over the dunes, a short camel ride, an Arabic buffet, and perhaps a belly dancer. Another option is to rent or buy a 4x4 and join one of the many 4x4 clubs in the UAE. The currency used in this text is the United Arab Emirates dirham (AED), also referred to as the dirham (dhs). The conversion rates for the dirham are 3.67 AED for 1 USD, 4.89 AED for 1 EUR, and 5.68 AED for 1 GBP. The dirham is pegged to the USD, so rate variations with this currency are unlikely.  The notes used in this currency are in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 dirhams. There is also a one dirham coin, with sub-units of 25 and 50 fils coins (100 fils). The UAE offers a wide variety of food from different cuisines, with Indian and Pakistani restaurants being the most popular. Grilled chicken is a popular dish, accompanied by rice, bread, and other accompaniments. Traditional Emirati dishes are rare in restaurants, but Yemeni cuisine is available. Pork is not illegal in the UAE, but it can be hard to find and is generally only available in certain stores and restaurants. The UAE offers a wide range of tourist accommodations, including modern, expensive hotels, more modest housing, and low-cost options that vary in condition. Notable landmarks include the Burj al-Arab in Dubai, known as a ""7-star hotel,"" and the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi, which also aspires to high standards at a lower price."
france,"France is the world's most popular tourist destination, with 83.7 million visitors in 2014. It is geographically diverse, containing areas such as Paris, the French Riviera, and the French Alps. France is also known for its rich emotions, turbulent politics, and its cuisine, culture, and history. In the Caribbean, France borders the Netherlands via the French territory of Saint-Martin, and it has five overseas regions: Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Reunion, and Mayotte. Numerous French overseas territories exist around the Earth with varying status. The text discusses the entry requirements for a particular program or institution. It mentions that applicants must meet certain criteria, such as having a specific level of education or experience, and that they may also need to provide additional information or documentation. The text emphasizes the importance of carefully reviewing the entry requirements before applying, in order to ensure that one's qualifications meet the necessary standards. The text suggests visiting various attractions in Paris, including the Eiffel Tower, Montmartre, the Louvre, and the Orsay Museum. It also recommends seeing modern architecture in La Defense, the Science Museum in Villette Park, and the Promenade Plantee. Other destinations include Versailles Palace, the TGV train from Paris to Lyon, the D-Day beaches of Normandy, Mont Saint Michel, Chartres Cathedral, the Alsace, the French Riviera, a bike ride along a section of Tour De France, Camargue, and Oradour-sur-Glane. The text discusses the importance of taking vacations for mental and physical health. It suggests that vacations can help reduce stress, improve mood, and increase productivity. The author also mentions the benefits of disconnecting from work and technology during vacation time. Additionally, the text encourages people to plan their vacations in advance and to make the most of their time off by engaging in activities that they enjoy. French cuisine can be very good, but it can also be disappointing. To find good food, research is necessary. French food can be found in various types of restaurants, from fine dining to casual dining. Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai food are available in Paris, but less common in smaller cities. Service and taxes are included in the bill. Fixed price menus are common, comprising appetizer, main dish, and dessert or cheese. Booking a table is often necessary, and it is illegal for a restaurant to turn you away without a legitimate reason. A lunch or dinner for two in a listed restaurant in Paris costs around €70 to €100, while a lunch or dinner for one in a decent Chinese restaurant in Paris can cost as little as €8. Prices are not always lower outside of Paris and the main cities, but the menu will include a fourth course, usually cheese. Be aware of tourist traps. If dissatisfied with food and/or service, speak to the waiter/manager, and by law, the restaurant is obliged to provide a new plate of food if the one served is not fresh, sufficiently hot, or inconsistent with the menu description. The text discusses the concept of short-term rentals, which refers to the temporary rental of a property for a limited duration, typically ranging from a few days to a few months. Short-term rentals can be a popular option for travelers, as they provide a convenient and flexible alternative to traditional hotel accommodations. However, the growth of short-term rentals has also raised concerns about their impact on the housing market and local communities. Some argue that short-term rentals can contribute to housing affordability issues, as they can lead to a decrease in the availability of long-term rental properties and an increase in home prices. Additionally, short-term rentals can have negative effects on neighborhoods, as they can lead to increased noise levels, parking issues, and a decrease in the sense of community."
uk,"The text emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between England, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland. It warns against using the terms ""England"" and ""The United Kingdom"" interchangeably, as this can be offensive to people from Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The text also clarifies that ""British"" and ""English"" are not synonymous, with ""British"" referring to the entire United Kingdom and ""English"" specifically referring to England. Additionally, the text notes that the Republic of Ireland is a separate state from the United Kingdom, having seceded from the Union in 1922 and gained full independence in 1937. The United Kingdom is physically linked to France and Ireland. The UK left the European Union at the end of January 2020 and does not fully implement the Schengen Agreement. Almost all passengers travelling to the UK from outside Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man go through systematic passport/identity card and selective customs checks carried out by UK Border Force on arrival in the UK. Those travelling by Eurostar from Paris Gare du Nord, Lille Europe, Calais-Fréthun and Brussels Zuid-Midi stations and by ferry from Calais and Dunkirk undergo UK passport/identity card checks in France/Belgium before embarkation and selective customs checks on arrival in the UK. Those entering the UK by Eurotunnel from France go through both UK passport/identity card and UK customs checks in Coquelles before boarding the train. The text encourages visitors to explore beyond London to experience the diversity of the region. It suggests visiting National Parks like the Yorkshire Dales or Dartmoor, coastal towns like St Ives, Whitby, and seaside resorts like Blackpool and Bournemouth. The text also recommends cities like Edinburgh, Chester, Bath, and York for their preserved heritage. Shoppers may want to visit Manchester, Bristol, Exeter, and Glasgow. The Northumberland coast between Newcastle upon Tyne and the Scottish Borders is highlighted as one of the most beautiful parts of the country. Conwy Valley on the edge of Wales is also recommended for its beautiful, off-the-beaten-path countryside. The British Pound has experienced significant fluctuations in its exchange rate following the Brexit referendum in June 2016. This volatility is expected to continue for an extended period. The text discusses the variety and quality of British food, noting that while there are stereotypes about British cuisine, it has improved significantly in recent decades. The British are proud of their native dishes, and restaurants and supermarkets in the middle and upper range offer high standards. However, food quality is variable at the budget end of the market. The UK can be expensive for eating out compared to southern European countries, but relatively cheap compared to countries like Switzerland and Norway. City center restaurants tend to be more expensive than suburban ones, and pubs in the countryside are slightly more expensive. A three-course meal without drinks costs between £20 and £35, and a main course and drink costs between £10 and £20. Chicken tikka masala with rice is sometimes claimed as the UK's most popular dish, but roast beef is a more traditional national dish. Picnic foods such as sandwiches, cakes, crisps, fresh fruit, cheeses, and drinks are readily available at supermarkets. Street markets are a good place to pick up fresh fruit and local cheeses at bargain prices. Bakeries and supermarkets sell pre-packed sandwiches, pastries, and cakes along with a range of soft drinks, juices, and mineral waters. Independent sandwich bars and bakers often provide better quality and value for money than national chains. Many large shops, especially department stores, have coffee shops or restaurants. British tolerance for poor quality coffee has improved, and it is not hard to find good quality coffee. Smoking is banned in all restaurants, cafés, bars, and pubs, but some establishments have provided smoking areas and smoking is allowed in the gardens/terraces outside pubs and restaurants unless otherwise stated. The British breakfast generally consists of cereal and toast with preserves or a fried breakfast of egg, bacon, sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms, and fried bread. The latter is known as a ""full English/Scottish/Welsh breakfast,"" depending on where you are, or simply a ""fry-up."" In Northern Ireland, it may be referred to as an ""Ulster Fry."" The Scottish variant may include haggis, and black or white pudding is sometimes included especially in the North. Larger hotels may also offer croissants, pastries, porridge, or kippers for breakfast. Some very large hotels will also provide an international selection including cold meat, cheese, boiled eggs, and a variety of different kinds of bread. The UK offers a range of accommodations, including hotels, bed and breakfast establishments, private houses, youth/backpackers' hostels, short term rental apartments, camp sites, and campervans/caravans. Budget chains like Premier Inn and Travelodge offer non-refundable rooms for as little as £29. There are also privately run bed and breakfasts that offer rooms with a full English breakfast. For budget travellers, there are youth/backpackers' hostels such as YHA England and Wales, Scottish YHA, and HI Northern Ireland. Independent Hostels offer a more relaxed regime than the YHA. Short term rental apartments are also available. Camp sites offer a range of facilities, and wild camping may be possible with permission from landowners. The Landmark Trust offers unique accommodations in historic buildings and follies."
thailand,"Thailand is a popular tourist destination in Southeast Asia, known for its diverse attractions, including its green jungles, crystal blue waters, and unique cuisine. The country offers a range of accommodations, from budget-friendly options to luxury hotels. Despite the high volume of tourism, Thailand retains its cultural and historical identity, and many visitors extend their stay or never leave. However, the country also faces challenges, such as income inequality, traffic congestion, and environmental degradation. Additionally, the cost of living in Thailand has increased, and some goods are more expensive than in the West. The Thailand eVisa will be pre-launched in four test countries before the end of the year: the United Kingdom, France, China, and the United Arab Emirates. However, if you have visited Thailand many times, particularly using visa-exempt entries, immigration officers may suspect that you are working illegally in the country and refuse your entry. They may also ask you to show 20,000 baht in cash to prove that you have money for your stay, and you will likely be sent back to the country you came from if you don't have it. Tourist visas are for genuine tourists, and getting several tourist visas per year will raise red flags with the authorities and have you detained and deported. Always get the correct type of visa because the government is getting stricter about refusing entry to and removing people who are abusing their tourist visa. The text discusses the concept of pampering and its importance in maintaining one's well-being. It suggests that taking time for oneself and engaging in self-care activities can lead to improved physical and mental health. The text also emphasizes the value of treating oneself to luxurious experiences, such as spa treatments or gourmet meals, as a way to recharge and rejuvenate. Overall, the text argues that pampering is a necessary and beneficial aspect of personal care and self-improvement. The baht is the currency of Thailand and is used as a measure of weight for gold. One baht of gold would cost around 19,000 baht in cash. The most useful bills are 20s and 100s, as many small shops and stalls don't carry much change. Taxi drivers may try to pull the ""no change"" trick. Beware of 1000-baht notes, as counterfeits are not uncommon. ATMs can be found in all cities and large towns, and international withdrawals are not a problem. When using a debit card, an ATM will typically provide a much better exchange rate than a money exchange counter. ATMs are available at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport (BKK) after collecting your bag and clearing customs. Some remote areas (including smaller islands) don't have banks or ATMs, so cash or traveller's checks are essential. Many hotels and guest houses will change money for guests, but hefty commissions and poor rates may apply. US dollars in small bills (1s, 5s, and 20s) are useful for onward travel to Laos and Cambodia, but are only useful in Thailand for exceptional purchases. Credit cards are widely accepted in the tourist industry, at larger tourist-oriented restaurants, shopping malls and grocery stores, and shops catering to tourists, but most local stores do not accept them. Fraud can happen, so use them sparingly and tell your bank in advance, so your card doesn't get locked down because ""you"" are using it. Some businesses add a surcharge (usually 2-3%) if you're paying by credit card; in this case, it can turn out cheaper to pay them in cash. Another problem with credit cards here is that no one appears to use the PIN option - it is always your signature. This makes it possible for your card to be hacked easier. As a result, only pay with cards as a very last resort."
turkey,"Turkey is a Muslim country founded in 1923 and is a member of the UN and NATO. It offers a variety of destinations, including Istanbul, Aegean Turkey, Mediterranean Turkey, Lycia, Pamphylia, Eastern Anatolia, Bodrum, Southeastern Anatolia, Eastern Karadeniz, and Central Anatolia. The country has a diverse landscape, ranging from mountains to beaches, and caters to different budgets and travel styles. The text discusses the challenges faced by international students in obtaining visas to study in the United States. It highlights the difficulties that students from certain countries may face in obtaining a visa, as well as the potential consequences of visa denial or expiration. The text also touches on the importance of proper documentation and the role of the U.S. government in regulating immigration. The text discusses the concept of ""doing"" in the context of a person's actions and behavior. It suggests that ""doing"" is an important aspect of a person's identity and that it is through their actions that they are able to express themselves and their values. The text also emphasizes the importance of considering the consequences of one's actions and the impact they have on others. It concludes by stating that ""doing"" is a fundamental aspect of human nature and that it is through our actions that we are able to make a difference in the world. The currency of Turkey is the Turkish Lira (TRY), which is divided into 100 kurus. The most useful currencies for exchange are Euro and American Dollars, but other currencies such as Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, Saudi Riyals, and Australian Dollars can also be exchanged. There are legal exchange offices in all cities and towns, and banks also exchange money, but they are not worth the hassle. Tourism-oriented towns and shops that handle large amounts of money usually accept foreign currency, but at lower rates than exchange offices. Visa and Mastercard are widely accepted, and ATMs are scattered throughout the cities. Tipping is customary in restaurants and cafes, and taxi drivers usually round up the fare to the next lira. Bargaining is common in shops, hotels, and other establishments. A VAT refund is available for non-residents, and there are duty-free shops in the airports. Turkish cuisine is rich in meat, particularly beef, and features a variety of vegetables such as eggplant, onion, lentil, bean, tomato, garlic, and cucumber. Spices are also abundantly used. Rice, bulgur wheat, and bread are the main staples, and dishes are typically cooked in vegetable oil or butter. There are many types of specialized restaurants, including traditional Turkish restaurants, kebab restaurants, fish restaurants, and others that specialize in one type of food. A full Turkish meal at a kebab restaurant usually starts with a soup and a set of appetizers, followed by a main course of meat, such as kebab or köfte. Eating on the cheap can be done at kebab stands, where a full loaf of bread filled with broiled meat, lettuce, onions, and tomatoes can be purchased for a few dollars. For a more authentic experience, it is recommended to go where the locals go, as these restaurants are likely to offer better quality and taste. The text discusses the wide range of accommodation options in Turkey, from luxurious 5-star hotels to basic tents on a large plateau. The cost of these accommodations also varies significantly."
usa,"Mark Twain's quote, ""Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness,"" highlights the importance of experiencing different cultures and perspectives. The United States is a large, complex, and diverse country with several distinct regional identities. Traveling between regions often involves crossing through many different landscapes, climates, and time zones, which can be time-consuming and expensive but is often very rewarding. The text provides information on obtaining a visa to travel to the United States. It is recommended to visit the US Department of State's Travel Website for specific information related to one's situation. Contacting the US Embassy, US Consulate, or Diplomatic Mission in one's country can provide better information on visa requirements. If a visa is required prior to travel, it must be obtained from the country of origin. There is no airside transit without US entry between international flights, and all travelers must disembark and proceed through immigration and customs inspection to enter the United States. Visas such as the Visa Waiver Program, visitor (B1 or B2), or transit (C1) visas may be necessary for entry. The text discusses various aspects of American culture, including music, sports, and national parks. It mentions the popularity of music concerts in large cities and outdoor amphitheaters, as well as smaller towns hosting concerts in parks. The text also highlights the importance of classical music concerts, which are performed by semi-professional and professional symphonies throughout the year.  The text also discusses the popularity of professional sports in the United States, including Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), the National Hockey League (NHL), IndyCar racing, NASCAR, and Major League Soccer (MLS). It notes that college sports are also widely followed in the United States, with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) governing college sports.  The text also mentions the importance of high school sports in American culture, with football and boys' basketball being the most widely followed sports at this level. It notes that many communities take great pride in their local high school teams and that games are a large part of local culture.  The text also discusses various national holidays and celebrations in the United States, including Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day. It notes that many towns and counties throw fairs to commemorate the establishment of a town or the county.  Finally, the text mentions the numerous national parks throughout the United States, which offer opportunities to enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, bird watching, and horseback riding. The text discusses the concept of money and its role in society. It explains that money is a tool used to facilitate trade and exchange of goods and services. It also touches upon the concept of inflation, which is the increase in the general price level of goods and services. The text emphasizes the importance of money in our daily lives and how it affects our economy. The text discusses the diversity of American cuisine, which is heavily influenced by foreign cuisines. The food found at ""Chinese"" or ""Mexican"" restaurants in the US may differ significantly from traditional Chinese or Mexican cuisine. The variety of restaurants in the US is remarkable, with many restaurants in major cities offering cuisine from nearly every country in the world. Some restaurants do not serve alcohol, while others have a BYOB policy. Fast food and chain restaurants are also prevalent in the US, with many open early in the morning and late at night, and serving large portions. The text discusses the varying costs of hotel rooms in the United States, with New York City and Honolulu being the most expensive cities. It also mentions that hotels in the US tend to be overpriced and offer poor value for what you get. Motels, on the other hand, are a more affordable option, especially for longer stays. Business hotels are also available across the country, with prices ranging from $70 to $170. Extended-stay hotels are another option, offering amenities such as full kitchens and continental breakfast. Hotels are available in most cities, with prices ranging from $80 to $300 per night. Camping can also be a very affordable lodging option, especially with good weather. The text also mentions unusual lodging options such as houseboats, treehouses, and renting furnished houses by the day."
italy,"Italy is a peninsula situated on the Mediterranean Sea, bordering France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia in the north. It is surrounded by the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian Seas to the west, the Mediterranean and Ionian Seas to the south, and the Adriatic Sea to the east. Italian is the official language, but there are several distinct Italian languages and dialects depending on the region. French is spoken in the northwest, German in the northeast, and Slovenian in border parts of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Italy has a diverse landscape, primarily mountainous, with two major islands: Sardinia and Sicily. The text provides information on the validity of travel documents required for entry into Italy. EU, EEA, and Swiss citizens, as well as non-EU citizens who are visa-exempt, only need a passport valid for the entirety of their stay. However, if entering from another Schengen area country, a passport valid for 6 months from entry may be required. Other nationals who are required to have a visa must have a passport valid for at least 3 months beyond their period of stay in Italy. For more information, visitors can refer to the webpage of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Italy. Foreign military entering Italy under a Status of Forces Agreement do not require a passport and only need to show their valid military identification card and travel orders. However, their dependants are not exempt from visa requirements. Non-EU, EEA, or Swiss citizens staying in Italy for 90 days or less must declare their presence within 8 days of arrival, and failing to do so may result in expulsion. Travellers staying longer than 90 days do not need to complete this declaration, but must instead have an appropriate visa and obtain a residence permit. In 2021, it is expected that travelers from visa-exempt countries will need to have a valid ETIAS visa waiver to enter Italy and other Schengen member countries for short-term visits. The text suggests visiting the beach as a way to relax and enjoy the outdoors. The text advises caution when exchanging money, as big-branded foreign exchange stalls in train stations and airports may charge high commissions and fixed amounts of euros. Smaller stalls in touristy areas offer more favorable rates. Italy can be expensive, with meals ranging from €3 to €20. Service is always included in the display price, and tipping is not necessary but not frowned upon. Tipping taxi drivers is not necessary, but hotel porters may expect a little something. Prices are inclusive of IVA sales tax, which is 22% for most goods and 10% in restaurants and hotels. Non-EU residents can get a partial VAT refund on purchases of goods that will be exported. Shops offering this scheme have a ""Tax Free"" sticker outside. Be sure to ask for your tax-free voucher and have your passport and address details ready before leaving the store. You need to purchase at least €155 worth of goods from a particular merchant during the course of one business day. These goods have to be unused when you pass the customs checkpoint upon leaving the EU. Credit cards may not be accepted in rural areas. Shops, offices, and banks close for up to 3 hours during the afternoon, often between 12.30 and 15.30. Banks have short hours with most only being open to the public for about 4 hours in the morning and barely 1 hour in the afternoon. The image shows two Italian dishes: Troffiette Genovese, which is pasta with pesto and wine, and Tiramisu Fanes, which is a dessert. The text discusses various types of accommodations in Italy, including hostels, camping sites, farmstays, and self-catering options. It notes that hostels are scarce, and that camping sites are well-managed but may not accept last-minute groups of young people. Farmstays are popular in rural areas of Tuscany, Piedmont, Umbria, Abruzzo, Sardinia, and Apulia, offering good food, sights, and prices. The text also mentions that hotel star ratings are a broad indication of quality and comfort, and that the star rating is based on facilities provided rather than comfort."
